        <h2>Where Am I?</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, traveler! You've made your way to a corner of the internet
        that has been dedicated to my worldbuilding project. Here, you'll find
        everything there is to know about the world of Veylune! Currently,
        that mostly consists of one continent, called Vaeloria. It may expand
        eventually, but for now, that's where all of the story takes place.
        </p>
        <p>
            So settle in, and take a look around! I hope you enjoy your stay!
        </p>

        <h2>What is Veylune?</h2>
        <p>
            Veylune is a high-fantasy world built on identity, resonance, and consequence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, magic is not a spell list or a resource to be spent—it is a reflection of who you are. 
        Every individual channels power through <b>Affinities</b>, vast domains like fire, shadow, space, life, 
        or mind, and through <b>Aspects</b>, the deeply personal ways that power manifests. 
        No two mages cast the same magic twice, because no two souls are shaped the same way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The world itself bears that same philosophy. Continents are carved by ancient ley-lines.
        Rivers define empires. Mountains hide anomalies where reality thins. Storms remember. Water watches.
        Shadows listen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Veylune is also a world of inheritance—of gifts passed down, distorted, or lost. Some bloodlines 
        carry the legacy of <b>Soulbinding</b>, a profound fusion between human and animal spirit that allows 
        full shapeshifting and reshapes culture, politics, and power. Once, this bond was gentle and mutual. 
        Now, history remembers it only through violence, scars, and half-forgotten myths.
        </p>
        <p>
            Across the continent of Vaeloria and beyond, societies rise around magic academies, Bound Houses, 
        ancient materials like heartsteel, and technologies that blur the line between spellcraft and engineering. 
        Lost arts linger at the edges of recorded knowledge, waiting in forgotten ruins, sealed sanctums, and
        stories that were never meant to survive.
        </p>
        <br>
        Veylune is a setting designed for depth:
        <ul style="margin: 0; list-style: ">
        <li>Magic systems that are consistent, personal, and narratively driven</li>
        <li>Cultures shaped by geography, lineage, and myth rather than trope</li>
        <li>A living world where philosophy, power, and identity are inseparable</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            Whether you’re here to explore lore, build stories, or simply wander a world that feels internally alive, 
        Veylune invites you to look closer.
            The world is not asking <i>what can you do?</i>
        It is asking <i>who are you, really—and what will the world become around you?</i>
