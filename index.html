            Hello, traveler! You've made your way to a corner of the internet
        that has been dedicated to my worldbuilding project. Here, you'll find
        everything there is to know about the world of Veylune! Currently,
        that mostly consists of one continent, called Vaeloria. It may expand
        eventually, but for now, that's where all of the story takes place.
        </p>
        <p>
            So settle in, and take a look around! I hope you enjoy your stay!
